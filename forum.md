## The forum

### What is the RECON forum?

The RECON forum provides a platform for public as well as private discussions relating to the use and development of tools for disease outbreaks analysis in R. Since March 2018, we have replaced the former *Discourse* forum by a simple [mailing list](https://mailman.ic.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/recon-forum), which turns out to be easier to use for most people. 


### What to use it for?

RECON member or not, you should feel free to join the forum and send post
relating to outbreak analysis. This can be, for instance:

- to ask a question about statistical methods, the use of a package, or on how
  to achieve a specific task in R
- to advertise a new position, an R package, a blog post, a relevant paper, or
  an event
- to advertise a need for staff deployment for an outbreak response
- to ask for help for a given project
- to offer a specific type of help

## RECON on slack

### What is slack?

[*Slack*](https://slack.com/) is a free instant messaging application running on multiple platforms, including mobile phones. It is ideal for discussing projects, coordinating ongoing developments, or getting help on technical issues.


### What to use it for?

Slack is designed for chat and interactive discussions; it will typically be more suitable than emails for:

- live project coordination
- rapid technical help
- chatting across computers and mobile devices



### How to use it?

You can join our slack organisation by [registering your email here](https://reconhub.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtNDYxNjI5MjAxMTU3LTBjOTc0MmZjY2FmYjk5ZTc3ZWU3YzdkMzRhMDlhNzM5MGVjYzFiMDU5MWIxNTRkYjVkNjY5NTk4ZGNjYjkyYjI). Once you confirmed your address, you can acess our slack by going to [reconhub.slack.com](https://reconhub.slack.com).
