### RECON gathering

These events are larger meetings aimed at fostering exchanges within the
community, drawing a snapshot of state-of-the-art epidemic analysis tools,
discussing recent outbreak response challenges as well as future directions
taken by our field, and creating new projects.

- [RECON gathering 1](https://recon-gathering-march2018.netlify.com/) (2018,
  London): *Challenges and Opportunities in Outbreak Response Analytics*; this
  event includes a one-day symposium followed by a day of workshops with 2
  parallel sessions: i) a discussion of analytic resources for field
  epidemiology training, and ii) a community-driven hackathon.
