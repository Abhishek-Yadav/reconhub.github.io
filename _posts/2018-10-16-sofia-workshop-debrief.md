The R Epidemics Consortium (RECON) together with the [EPIET Alumni Network
(EAN)](http://epietalumni.net/) and National Center of Infectious and Parasitic
Diseases, Bulgaria, organised a short 4-day course titled "[an introduction into
using R for surveillance and outbreak
analytics](https://recon-sofia-2018.netlify.com/)". The course was held from the
8-11 October 2018 in Sofia, Bulgaria, and delivered by Savina Soistova (National
Center of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, Bulgaria), Thibaut Jombart, Zhian
Kamvar, and Janetta Skarp. This was the first course RECON organised tailored to
participants with a Field-Epidemiology background. The course was attended by
more than 25 people from mostly Eastern European members states working at WHO,
MSF, ECDC, academics, and multiple national health agencies. Content of the
course was determined by a survey sent to the participants well before the
course started in which they stated their interests for subjects within the
course.

Day 1 of the course covered an introduction into the use of R, RStudio, good
data science  practices, and simple descriptive analyses. On Day 2, participants
were acquainted with performing multi-variable analyses for outbreak analyses.
Day 3 focussed on outbreak response analytics , simulating the early stages of a
novel Ebola epidemics. For the last day participants were invited to bring
forward their own questions regarding data analyses in R.

The event was a great opportunity to bring together colleagues from a wide range
of Eastern European institutions, discuss various topics and practices in
outbreak data analytics, and identify current needs and gaps to fill in todayâ€™s
analytics toolbox. [All materials used during this course have been made freely
available on GitHub](https://github.com/reconhub/workshop-sofia-2018). The RECON
team would like to thank our participants for coming and turning this event into
a very enjoyable experience; special thanks to Savina for being such an
excellent host, and showing us all around in beautiful Sofia.
