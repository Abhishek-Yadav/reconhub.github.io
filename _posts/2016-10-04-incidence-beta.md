*incidence* provides tools for incidence computation, visualisation, and modelling.
Currently available features include:

- computation of incidence from: `Date`, `POSIXct`, `integer`, or `numeric`
- computation of incidence for any fixed time interval, optionally by groups
- easy handling of results using `[` and `subset`
- plotting using *ggplot2*
- modelling of incidence using log-linear regression
- computation of daily growth rate, doubling / halving time, and predicted incidence, including confidence intervals


The next few days we will focus on testing features, polishing the doc, and improving unit testing coverage.
